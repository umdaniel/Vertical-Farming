# Vertical-Farming
Go Produce is a online shopping experience geared to individuals looking to purchase produce from their local vertical farm. 

Our Mission: to bring high quality and affordable produce straight to you without any of the in betweens.

Go Produce is a business idea that is still in the workings. The general idea is to reduce the amount of yearly food waste due to transportation issues by implementing vertical farms in every main city. Consumers can purchase produce grown in these vertical farms through this website. Produce will be sent directly to the consumer without having to go through the hassle of multiple transporations.
